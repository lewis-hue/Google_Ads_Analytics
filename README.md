# PRODUCT ANALYTICS
## Google Ads Analytics in Amplitude

This project uses **Amplitude**, a leading **product analytics** tool, to optimize **Google Ads** campaigns by analyzing **user behavior** and **marketing analytics**. By tracking engagement data across platforms like **Google**, **YouTube**, and **Google Display Network**, we identify opportunities to improve conversions and cost efficiency. With **Amplitude**, we focus on actionable data, optimizing the customer journey, and aligning marketing efforts with measurable business impact to drive **customer lifetime value**.


### Data Ingestion

#### Process:
The first step involved connecting my Google Adwords account with Amplitude. This step helped provide data on ad performance metrics, including clicks, conversions, cost, impressions, and interactions across different ad platforms like Google, YouTube, and Google Display Network. This data was crucial in analyzing user engagement and the effectiveness of each ad campaign, allowing for better optimization of ad spend and targeting strategies.

### Marketing Analytics Settings

In this project, Amplitude‚Äôs marketing analytics settings are configured to optimize Google Ads campaigns by analyzing user behavior and ad performance across platforms like Google, YouTube, and Google Display Network. Key metrics such as clicks, conversions, cost, impressions, and interactions are tracked and segmented by ad group type, ad platform, and campaign dates. Custom filters, including final_url and ad_account_id, enable detailed breakdowns of user acquisition and page engagement. Ad metrics like ad_metrics.clicks, ad_metrics.conversions, ad_metrics.cost, and ad_metrics.interactions provide actionable insights to enhance campaign effectiveness and optimize user journeys.

#### Business Implication:
High-performing stores like Store_A and Store_D can be used as benchmarks for best practices in staffing, layout, and inventory management.

Expansion strategies may prioritize locations replicating demographics or operations of top stores.

Underperforming stores (relative to their peers) should undergo a profitability and efficiency audit.
### Revenue by Country

#### Analysis:
The global sales distribution is diverse and competitive:

USA is the top market with over $73,000 in revenue.

India, Japan, and France represent key international contributors.

Emerging markets like Brazil, Mexico, and Australia show significant untapped potential.

#### Business Implication:
Localized campaigns in the USA can yield immediate gains due to existing traction.

India and Japan should be considered for strategic expansion, especially given their revenue parity.

Emerging markets like Brazil and Mexico might benefit from regional promotions or price-sensitive product variants.
