In this project, Amplitude’s marketing analytics settings are configured to optimize Google Ads campaigns by analyzing user behavior and ad performance across platforms like Google, YouTube, and Google Display Network. Key metrics such as clicks, conversions, cost, impressions, and interactions are tracked and segmented by ad group type, ad platform, and campaign dates. Custom filters, including final_url and ad_account_id, enable detailed breakdowns of user acquisition and page engagement. Ad metrics like ad_metrics.clicks, ad_metrics.conversions, ad_metrics.cost, and ad_metrics.interactions provide actionable insights to enhance campaign effectiveness and optimize user journeys.

### Ad Clicks per Ad_Platform
![Ad Clicks per Ad_Platform](https://github.com/lewis-hue/Google_Ads_Analytics/blob/main/Ad%20Clicks%20per%20Ad_Platform.png)
#### Analysis:
Based on the results, Google Display Network had the highest total event count of 17 ad clicks, followed by Google with 16, and YouTube with 12 within the last 60 days. The Google Display Network (GDN) leading in total clicks suggests it may be reaching a broader audience and attracting higher user engagement compared to the other platforms. GDN typically serves display ads across millions of websites, apps, and videos, which could explain its higher event count. This type of ad format tends to perform well in generating visibility and clicks due to its visual nature, particularly in remarketing campaigns.

Google follows closely with 16 clicks, which is expected given its dominant search engine presence. Google Ads (Search) generally captures intent-driven traffic, where users actively search for products or services, making it an essential channel for high-quality leads.

YouTube, with 12 ad clicks, ranks third. Although it generates less immediate click-through than GDN or Google Search, it still plays a vital role in brand awareness and engagement, especially with video content. YouTube ads often generate deeper engagement and brand recall but may not always lead to immediate clicks compared to other ad formats.

#### Implications:

* **Refining Audience Targeting:**

  * **Google Display Network**: Given its highest click count, further refine audience targeting by expanding to interest-based, behavioral, and lookalike audiences to reach a wider demographic and boost engagement.
  * **Google Search**: Since Google Search Ads have a close click count, focus on narrowing down specific, long-tail search terms to capture more qualified leads, and incorporate negative keywords to filter irrelevant traffic.
  * **YouTube**: With fewer clicks, improve targeting by leveraging in-market audiences and retargeting users who have previously interacted with your brand. Optimize video content with strong CTAs for better engagement.

* **Optimizing Ad Formats and Placement:**

  * **Google Display Network**: Given its higher clicks, experiment with different ad formats like responsive display ads and native ads to improve click-through rates (CTR) and engagement. Use remarketing to re-engage users who have interacted with your brand.
  * **YouTube**: Focus on optimizing video ads to improve CTR. Test skippable ads for broader reach and non-skippable ads for better impact, focusing on short, engaging content to improve user interaction.

* **Improve Campaign Scheduling:**

  * Analyze the time of day and days of the week when Google Display Network and Google Ads get the highest click rates, and schedule ads to run during peak times for better user interaction.

* **Tracking and Analyzing Performance:**

  * Track **Cost Per Click (CPC)** and **Conversion Rate (CVR)** for each platform to measure performance. Allocate more budget to **Google Display Network** if traffic is high, and optimize landing pages or targeting for platforms like **YouTube** where the conversion rate is lower.

### AD Conversion Per Platform


#### AD Conversion Per Platform
![AD Conversion Per Platform](https://github.com/lewis-hue/Google_Ads_Analytics/blob/main/AD%20Conversion%20Per%20Platform.png)


The **Google Display Network** achieved the highest total of **17 ad clicks**, surpassing **Google** with **16** clicks and **YouTube** with **12** clicks over the past 60 days. This indicates that **Google Display Network** is effectively reaching a broad audience, likely through visually engaging display ads that attract more interactions. While **Google Search** ads follow closely, their higher intent-driven nature likely leads to a more targeted audience but slightly fewer interactions. **YouTube**, with its lower click count, may have a different goal—such as brand awareness—requiring more engagement strategies.

### **Implications for Improving Google Ads Based on Clicks:**

* **Refining Audience Targeting:**

  * **Google Display Network**: Since it drives the most clicks, expand audience targeting by leveraging **interest-based**, **behavioral**, and **lookalike audiences**. Focus on optimizing **remarketing campaigns** to re-engage users who clicked but did not convert.
  * **Google Search**: With slightly fewer clicks, refine keyword targeting to focus on **long-tail** terms and higher-conversion keywords. Adding **negative keywords** will help filter irrelevant clicks, improving click quality.
  * **YouTube**: With fewer clicks, improve **targeting** by focusing on **in-market audiences** and **retargeting** users who have already interacted with your brand. Enhance engagement with **strong calls-to-action (CTAs)** in the video content to convert more views into clicks.

* **Optimizing Ad Formats and Placement:**

  * **Google Display Network**: Given its high click count, experiment with **responsive display ads** and **native ads** that blend with the content on websites. Consider varying **ad placements** to reach users across a broader network.
  * **YouTube**: Optimize video content for higher engagement. Test **skippable video ads** for wider reach and **non-skippable ads** for more guaranteed impact. Focus on **short, engaging** video content to drive higher interaction.

* **Improve Campaign Scheduling:**

  * Analyze the specific times and days when the **Google Display Network** drives the most clicks, and schedule ads accordingly. This could help maximize user interaction and improve the efficiency of ad spend.

* **Tracking and Analyzing Performance:**

  * Monitor key metrics like **Cost Per Click (CPC)** and **Conversion Rate (CVR)** across platforms to ensure budget allocation aligns with performance. For example, if **Google Display Network** continues to drive high click counts but lower conversion rates, optimizing landing pages and targeting will be crucial to turning those clicks into more conversions. Conversely, for **YouTube**, improving ad engagement can lead to more clicks over time.

### Advertising Costs per Platform
![Advertising Costs per Platform](https://github.com/lewis-hue/Google_Ads_Analytics/blob/main/Cost%20of%20Advertising%20for%20Different%20Ad%20Platforms.png)


The **Google Display Network** had the highest advertising expenditure, totaling **\Ksh 4942.42**, followed by **Google** at **\Ksh 3989.38**, and **YouTube** at **\Ksh 3779.89**. The higher spend on **Google Display Network** indicates that it is being heavily utilized to reach a broader audience through display ads. Display campaigns often require a larger budget due to their wide reach and visual nature. **Google Search**, with its targeted intent-driven approach, had a slightly lower spend, but still represents a significant portion of the ad budget. **YouTube**, with its lower cost, suggests that it is being used for more specific campaign objectives like brand awareness or engagement, where the goal may not necessarily be immediate conversions.

### **Implications for Improving Google Ads Based on Advertising Cost Findings:**

* **Budget Allocation:**

  * **Google Display Network**: Given its high expenditure, it is important to ensure that the budget spent is generating returns in the form of conversions and engagement. If **Google Display Network** is driving clicks but not enough conversions, reallocate some budget to platforms with better conversion rates (e.g., **YouTube**) or adjust targeting strategies to improve cost efficiency.
  * **Google Search**: With a moderate spend, **Google Search** continues to be cost-effective due to its intent-driven traffic. Consider slightly increasing the budget here if **conversion rates** are high to capture more high-quality leads. Ensure that **keyword targeting** remains tight to avoid wasteful spending.
  * **YouTube**: Despite having the lowest cost, YouTube ads can still be an essential part of the marketing strategy. Consider increasing the budget for **YouTube** to target more in-market and retargeting audiences, especially if it demonstrates a high conversion rate or strong user engagement, which may justify more investment.

* **Optimizing Ad Spend Efficiency:**

  * **Google Display Network**: Since this platform incurs the highest cost, optimize ads by improving targeting, testing different ad formats (e.g., native vs. display ads), and ensuring the landing pages are optimized for conversions. **Remarketing** campaigns could also help reduce wasted spend by targeting users who have already shown interest in your products.
  * **YouTube**: For **YouTube**, ensure that **ad creatives** are highly engaging and have clear **CTAs** to improve the return on spend. Focus on targeting users who are most likely to engage with video content, which could potentially lead to better conversion rates and higher ROI.

* **Campaign Type and Ad Format Testing:**

  * For **Google Display Network**, test different **ad formats** and placements to see which yields the highest engagement at the lowest cost. Consider using **responsive display ads** or **native ads** that blend into content, providing a less intrusive user experience, which can improve engagement and reduce costs.
  * On **YouTube**, try adjusting **ad formats** such as **skippable** and **non-skippable ads** to understand which resonates best with your audience and drives the most cost-effective conversions.

* **Cost per Conversion Tracking:**

  * Track **Cost Per Conversion (CPC)** and adjust spend based on platform performance. If **Google Display Network** continues to incur high costs but doesn’t convert well, consider adjusting the targeting, creative approach, or allocating budget to more conversion-efficient platforms. On the other hand, if **YouTube** is proving to be a cost-effective channel for conversion, increasing the budget may result in higher returns.

By refining budget allocation, improving targeting, and optimizing ad formats, it’s possible to enhance overall campaign performance while minimizing unnecessary costs.

### Clicks Per Ad Group
![Clicks Per Ad Group](https://github.com/lewis-hue/Google_Ads_Analytics/blob/main/Clicks%20Per%20Ad%20Group.png)

The findings reveal that Group_6 has the highest click rate at 16.1%, while Group_9 and Group_1 have the lowest at 6.9%. Since Group_6 is generating the highest click rate, it should be considered to expand its audience targeting to further capitalize on its success. On the other hand, Group_9 and Group_1, with lower click rates, should be optimized by refining targeting and creatives to boost engagement and improve click performance.

**###: Implications for Improving Google Ads Based on Clicks per Ad Group**

Refining Ad Group Targeting:

Group_6: Since Group_6 is generating the highest click rate, it should be considered to expand its audience targeting. Leveraging similar ad creatives and targeting strategies across other groups may help replicate this success.

Group_9 and Group_1: Since these groups are generating the lowest click rates, it should be considered to refine their audience targeting. Review their ad creatives, keywords, and demographics to ensure they are relevant to the audience. Expanding targeting or testing new approaches may help increase clicks.

Optimizing Ad Creatives and Messaging:

Group_6: Since Group_6 is generating the highest click rate, it should be considered to analyze the successful ad creatives and messaging to identify what is resonating with the audience. Apply these insights to other ad groups to improve their click-through rates.

Group_9 and Group_1: Since these groups are generating the lowest click rates, it should be considered to improve their ad copy, visuals, and CTAs. Testing new creative formats or more engaging messaging could help increase click performance.

Testing and Experimenting with Targeting:

Group_6: Since Group_6 is generating the highest click rate, it should be considered to expand its audience targeting further, using lookalike audiences or interest-based targeting. This could help increase the volume of clicks while maintaining the effectiveness of the campaign.

Group_9 and Group_1: Since these groups are generating the lowest click rates, it should be considered to experiment with new targeting approaches. Testing broader or more niche targeting based on user behavior or intent signals may improve engagement.

Analyzing Campaign Performance by Group:

Group_6: Since Group_6 is generating the highest click rate, it should be considered to scale the campaign by increasing the budget or expanding its reach to new audiences. Monitor the performance to ensure the click rate remains stable or continues to improve.

Group_9 and Group_1: Since these groups are generating the lowest click rates, it should be considered to perform a deeper analysis on their performance metrics like CPC and Conversion Rates. Adjusting targeting or creative strategies to drive more cost-effective clicks could improve overall performance.

### Interactions Per Ad Group Type
![Interactions Per Ad Group Type](https://github.com/lewis-hue/Google_Ads_Analytics/blob/main/Interactions%20Per%20Ad%20Group%20Type.png)

Based on the findings, the Search ad group type had the highest total event count of 7 interactions, followed by both Video and Display with 4 interactions each within the last 60 days. This suggests that Search ads are performing the most effectively in terms of user engagement, likely due to the intent-driven nature of search queries. Users who search for specific products or services are generally more likely to engage and take action.

In comparison, Video and Display ads, both with 4 interactions, show that these ad formats are less engaging in terms of immediate interaction. While video ads often drive awareness and impressions, they may not always lead to direct interactions as quickly as search ads. Display ads, while effective in reaching a large audience and generating impressions, may need refinement in targeting or content to drive more meaningful interactions.

### Implications for Improving Google Ads Based on Interaction Findings:

Refining Audience Targeting:

Search Ads: Since Search has the highest interactions, continue refining keyword targeting to capture more high-intent queries. Consider adding negative keywords to exclude irrelevant traffic and further boost interaction quality.

Video Ads: Focus on improving targeting for Video ads by reaching users who are more likely to engage, such as those who have previously interacted with similar content or those in-market for the product. Using retargeting and lookalike audiences can help increase interactions.

Display Ads: To increase Display ad interactions, refine targeting using interest-based and behavioral targeting. Ads may need to be more relevant to the user’s current stage in the customer journey. Using dynamic display ads that adapt to users' past interactions can improve engagement.

Optimizing Ad Formats and Placement:

Search Ads: Continue using text-based search ads that align with user intent, but also experiment with responsive search ads to test various headlines and descriptions, enhancing relevance and interaction.

Video Ads: Since Video ads had lower interactions, test skippable ads to increase reach while improving the content. Additionally, focusing on non-skippable ads or TrueView ads could help in building more engaged users.

Display Ads: Experiment with native ads and responsive display ads to improve engagement. Native ads often blend seamlessly with website content and are known to increase interactions compared to traditional display ads.

Improving Campaign Scheduling:

Analyze peak interaction times for each ad group type and schedule ads accordingly. For Search ads, target high-intent search periods, while for Video and Display ads, experiment with running ads at times when users are most likely to engage.

Tracking and Analyzing Performance:

Monitor interaction rates for each ad type and adjust the budget allocation to reflect the most engaging ad formats. If Search continues to drive higher interactions, consider allocating more of the budget to Search ads, while experimenting with Video and Display ads to improve engagement through better targeting, creative optimization, or format adjustments.
